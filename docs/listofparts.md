This is hopefully the list of all parts I needed. For better orientation it is devided over multimple subassemblies

# Power supply and basic elements
* 9V regulated power plug (Main Power input)
* prototyping PCB board
* Wires, double wires and ribbon cables
* 2 port contact terminal or 9v power socket

# core processing element 
(Needed to test the software)
* arduino nano
* SI 470x Radio Module
* 8x8 LED Matrix board with max7219 driver
* 5 wire connector cable
* photodiode
* 10 k Resistor
* encoder switch with button function
* button (Easy to hit)
* switch with tight movement
* cheap earphone (need just the cable with the plug as antenna an input to the amplifier)

# Audio amplifier 
(Needed to hear anything without earphone)
* lm7805 voltage regulator
* 100nf capacitor
* 470nf capacitor
* lm386 operations amplifier
* 20k potentionmeter
* 100nF capacitor
* 2x 100uF capacitor
* Speaker (8cm diameter)
* 2 port Contact terminal

# Housing 
(Needed, so you dont fall into your electronics at night)
* plywood 4-6mm of your favourite kind
* green light filter (to reduce overall brightness of the red led)
* Anything to hold everythin together (Scews, nuts, glue etc)
