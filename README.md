# ElBanquos_AlarmClock
An Arduino based radio alarm clock with a unqie display method and an efficient user interface

# Introduction
Actual alarm clocks are often not designed very well, because they try to be cheap and very multifunctional.
Iwank to create an alarm clock, that is optimized for that purpose by enhancen the essential features an reducing all gimmicks not necessary for the job.

Essential functions of a radio alarm clock
* show the actual time (in a good adapted brightness)
* Play radio to wake me up (fading it smothly in)
* efficient and reliable change of alarm time
* ensure correct volume of sound (minimize risk of silent alaem due to bad volume controller)
* Get correct time through available broadcast services (RDS is best, since we need a radio module anyway)
* Snooze function
* "Hard to Kill" alarm off procedure (Procedure needs more then just hitting a button)
* Switch bewteen alarm mode and non alarm mode
* stop bothering after (1?) Hour

Personal essential feature
* show time in a pattern, a short sighted person still can recognize over 2 meters 
* Dim up light to simulate sunrise 

Nice to have functions
* Sleep function - Play Radio on demand for a defined time and fade it out smoothly
* Multiple Alarm timers (configurable to be "one shot", "daily", "Weekly on defined Weekdays")

Unecessary function
* Play radio for endless time
* Change radio stations (I always wake up with the same)
* Show Radio Station name
* shot weather and other data etc.
